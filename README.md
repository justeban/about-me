# about-me
About me project for week 1 of code 201.

#### Overview
In this "About Me" project I created a quiz about me. In this project I created a function that will be called when the user clicks the "Take the Quiz" button in the bottom corner rather than just automatically firing when the user opens the browser. The questions to be asked in the quiz I stored in array and I created similar arrays for "correct response", "incorrect responses", and the correct and incorrect answers. 

#### Questions Asked 
These are the questions that were asked for the quiz: 
    1. 'Do you think I was born in Mexico?', 
        
    2. 'Do you think that I know how to play the clarinet?',

    3. 'Do you think I was once hit in the head with a chunk of asphalt?',

    4. 'Would you believe me if I said I met my wife on "The Bachelorette"?',

    5. 'Would believe that I was once struck by lightning?'
